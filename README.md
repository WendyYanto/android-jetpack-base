# android-jetpack-base

This is android's boilerplate for me to setup new project.
It will include:

- [ ] Viewmodel for lifecycle-aware business logic implementation
- [ ] Livedata for implementation of observer pattern between UI and data flows
- [ ] Retrofit for HTTP client
- [ ] Android view binding for typesafe UI-logic interaction 
- [ ] Dagger hilt for dependency injection
- [ ] Workmanager for job scheduling management
- [ ] Gradle KTS for build logic scripting
- [ ] Glide for image loader
- [ ] Coroutine flows for asynchronous IO operations
- [ ] Room for local data storage persistence 
- [ ] Multi module to support dynamic feature delivery
