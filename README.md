# android-jetpack-base

This is android's boilerplate for me to setup new project.
It will include:

1. Viewmodel for lifecycle-aware business logic implementation
2. Livedata for implementation of observer pattern between UI and data flows
3. Retrofit for HTTP client
4. Android view binding for typesafe UI-logic interaction 
5. Dagger hilt for dependency injection
6. Workmanager for job scheduling management
7. Gradle KTS for build logic scripting
8. Glide for image loader
9. Coroutine flows for asynchronous IO operations
10. Room for local data storage persistence
